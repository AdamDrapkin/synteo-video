What's going on, guys? This video, we're gonna be talking about for what qualifies for a payout, so…

1
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.610
What are the do's and don'ts when it comes to what platforms you're posting on, how you're posting, what you're posting.

2
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.760
And everything along those lines, so that you're following the guidelines and you're actually getting paid out for the work that you're doing.

3
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.190
So, to start off, let's talk about our monthly budget.

4
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:38.300
So every month, our clients will give us a specific budget for the views that they want to generate. Their budget can range between $10,000 and $100,000 or more per month, maybe even a million dollars per month.

5
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.370
That entire budget will go towards paying you, aka the Clipper, for generating those views. So, general rule of thumb is a dollar for a thousand views.

6
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.220
It can be more. Sometimes, depending on the client, it's $2 for 1,000 views.

7
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.150
Depending on the style of content, if you're doing UGC content, that would pay out $3 for 1,000 views.

8
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.180
And there are bonus opportunities for hitting certain milestones, for posting for a certain number of days.

9
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.660
Creating specific accounts, all those things, those are all going to be included, and those are milestones that get paid out as well.

10
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.880
Once the monthly budget is finished, any views accumulated in that month, they won't be paid out until the next month's budget.

11
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.150
So this rarely happens, but…

12
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.260
At the end of the month, there are times where you are gaining views, and the client runs out of their budget, and then their next budget starts maybe the next day.

13
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.880
You will not…

14
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.680
get paid out until that next day. So, you will get paid out for the views, but sometimes that might be a few days, couple days delayed.

15
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.360
So just keep that in mind. Just want you to be sure… be aware of that. You will get paid out.

16
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.960
It just might not be immediately if it's at near the end of the budget.

17
00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:05.330
Now, one really cool thing is not only are you going to be getting paid out for the views that you're generating, but depending on the client, you can also earn a sales commission for every sale your content drives. So, there's these things called affiliate links.

18
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.210
is a big… proponent of this. They have…

19
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:27.640
affiliate links for all of their communities. The creators of the coaching programs, communities, online businesses, whatever it is on WAP, they can choose what percentage commission they want to give for all affiliates that drive those sales. So when you actually create your account.

20
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.490
you put the link in the bio, it's gonna be your affiliate link. So then when someone signs up for the coaching program that you're driving sales to, if it's a coaching program.

21
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.700
You can actually earn a commission on those sales.

22
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.740
And I'll go over some of the… all of the affiliate stuff in a separate video, but…

23
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.700
Just want to make you aware that not only are you getting paid out for the views, you can also be paid out on a commission base for the sales that you drive using your content.

24
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:09.470
So now let's talk about content qualifications. The platforms that we'll accept posts on include Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and X slash Twitter. Those are the four. If you're not posting on those four, you're not gonna get paid out. We don't really care about LinkedIn.

25
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.410
Facebook Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, make sure you're posting on those four only.

26
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:31.310
All clips must be original content. No reposts of other people's content. You cannot just repurpose someone else's content and post it and pretend it's your own. We will know, we have a software that can detect these things, and you won't get approved, you won't get paid out.

27
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:42.950
So, you can use parts of someone else's content, but make sure you're changing the audio, you're changing the style, you're using parts of it. It has to be your original content. You're changing the overlays, whatever it might be.

28
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.110
All the videos must be at least 10 seconds long.

29
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.380
You cannot have a 2-second video. Even if it goes viral, it generates 3 trillion views. You're not gonna get paid out for it. It has to be at least 10 seconds long.

30
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.810
Your audience location must be at least 50% English-focused, so that's US, UK, California, Australia, England.

31
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:18.959
Yeah, at least 50% English-focused. You can have the other 50% be non-English focused, but at least 50% of that audience from that account has to be English-focused.

32
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:32.950
The next two are very, very, very important. No botted views, no paid promo, must be organic views. You cannot pay for views, we have a software that detects these, and you will get denied and banned immediately.

33
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.020
We are not… In the market for botted views, and we're not paying you out for any botted views.

34
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.260
And no paid promo, no boosting your content.

35
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.340
You cannot pay for views. This has to be organic views that you're generating.

36
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.900
And again, no spamming posts. There should be at least 2-3 hours between each post,

37
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:08.740
make sure… you don't want to get blocked on Instagram for spamming posts. Action blocked, you can get suspended or even banned for these things, so make sure you're spacing it out at least 2-3 hours between each post.

38
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.110
And again, this is a quality, not a quantity game.

39
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.330
If you post 3 pieces of really good content that go off, and you generate 3 million views, that's $3,000 in your pocket.

40
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.420
So those are the content qualifications,

41
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.560
Again, if there's any other way that you guys are gonna be generating views that aren't organic,

42
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.230
feel free to know that they will not be paid out. They have to be organic views, we know when they're not.

43
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.730
So don't try any sneaky business.

44
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:48.290
But these are the content qualifications. As long as you're following all of these things, you will be paid out, for the views that you generate for our clients.

45
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.400
So… See you on the next video, see you on the live training, and… Good luck to you guys.
