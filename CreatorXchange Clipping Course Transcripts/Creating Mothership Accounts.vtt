What's up, guys? So, this video, we're gonna be talking about creating mothership accounts, and this is…

1
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.059
This is essentially optional, but it's something that I think all Clippers should be doing.

2
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.730
Because it's something that…

3
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:30.250
will help you gain more views over time, and make it a lot easier to kickstart accounts. And you'll know what I mean by that after I go through this, but this is really important.

4
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.850
Especially if you want to be…

5
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.700
generating views right off the bat when you create client accounts. So… moving to…

6
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.250
How to create a mothership account.

7
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.820
Before I do this, I just want to explain exactly what it is. So…

8
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.570
A mothership account is basically going to be a niche-specific account where you take content

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:04.230
and repurpose it and repost content in a specific niche. So, let's say you have a sports niche, you would post content maybe from ESPN or NFL,

10
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.970
NBA, MLB, and repurpose content that's already on social media, and repost it onto your account.

11
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.320
and basically become a sports clips page. Now, why is that important for client accounts?

12
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.980
Well… If you create a niche-specific page for business.

13
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.530
and you then have a business niche creator that you're… that is a client that you're clipping for, you can actually use your Mothership account and collab

14
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.970
With your new account, so that your new account gets more views right off the bat.

15
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
And if you don't know what the Instagram collab is, this is something that

16
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.970
I can go over, in a minute. But, essentially, you will be… Tagging your new account

17
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.910
onto your Mothership account, and it'll be a post on your new account.

18
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.900
But your Mothership account followers will also get to see that first.

19
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.830
So…

20
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:12.910
Picking your niche. You want to choose something that has an abundance of content available on IG, TikTok, YouTube, and X. It's best to pick slight variations of tried and true social media niches.

21
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:29.910
The second thing is that you want to pick a niche that's broad enough so that you can use it to collab with other pages you create for our clients, which is what I was talking about earlier. Example, creating account for all things related to making money. So, if you have a niche account that's about side hustles, or

22
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.580
making money online, or just business. Those are gonna be really, really good accounts for that, for our clients that we bring on, that you could then collab with.

23
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.430
Once your niche is selected, it's time to actually create your account. So this is gonna be the very… the same thing as creating your client account. You're gonna make a fresh email.

24
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.830
Select your username, make sure it's…

25
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.050
You know, something that is a little bit catchy.

26
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.680
you know, there's a lot of usernames that are available on Instagram.

27
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.620
like I said, use a thesaurus, find synonyms. Sports clips, obviously probably isn't…

28
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:19.020
Available, but, depending on your niche, there's gonna be plenty of usernames that you can use, so just make sure you're using the one that coincides with the niche that you chose.

29
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:33.390
When selecting a logo, you're going to search your niche, followed by vector on Google Images, and then pick one that you like. This is just a simple hack, you'll find a bunch of logos that you can use, and just pick one.

30
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:44.440
And it's important that your account is very aesthetically pleasing. You're looking to replicate the way an Apple commercial feels when creating your account. Very simplistic, very aesthetically pleasing.

31
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.220
All of your videos, your profile, is going to look

32
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.880
Pleasing, it's not gonna look like a mess.

33
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.400
Now, it's time to start posting, so you're gonna download CapCut. This is gonna be the main app that you're using.

34
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.630
Download the content that has performed successfully in your niece. You're gonna use a website to do this, you don't have to save via the platform, because then it has the watermark.

35
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.590
But download the content that has performed successfully in your niche. So you're gonna go to Instagram, search your niche, find… go over to the Reels tab.

36
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.709
And then just find the ones that have gone the most viral, that have performed the best.

37
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.600
So if you're saving videos from Instagram, Google IG Downloader, click on, I think, the first link, paste the link of the video onto the website.

38
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.320
And download it.

39
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.880
Download the highest quality available.

40
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.760
It's gonna probably be a lot of gigs, but…

41
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:48.380
Don't worry about it. Make sure you're downloading the highest quality version available. Once you post it, you can delete it, if that's something you want to do. But once it's downloaded, crop it so that there's no white or black space on the borders of the actual video.

42
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.970
You want it to look clean.

43
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.920
Now, import the video into CapCut, adjust the ratio to TikTok format.

44
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.420
That's what it says in CapCut. Really, it's 9x16, which is the Reels format on Instagram as well. So it's TikTok or Reels format, those are the same exact format.

45
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.750
Next, you'll create a sticker.

46
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.330
you've probably seen on Instagram or TikTok those videos that

47
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.450
It's like a regular video, and then on the very top, there's almost like a caption.

48
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:37.640
that'll say, like, if only there was a page dedicated only to sports clips. You're gonna create something like that, and all you have to do to create the sticker is just tweet a phrase of your choice, and then screenshot it. You don't even have to post a tweet, just write it in the tweet box, and then screenshot it. You want to use the tweet because that's the…

49
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.430
Format that does the best.

50
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:51.510
So you're gonna crop that screenshot to just the text, and now you have your sticker. So you're gonna paste the sticker above the video to caption it. It's best to rotate through multiple of these when growing the account, so…

51
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.800
If only there was a page dedicated only to sports clips,

52
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:07.890
POV, you came here to watch sports, something like that, that you're gonna put on top of the video, just to make it, have that caption, and then it's also gonna make your page look more aesthetically pleasing.

53
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:23.780
Another thing is, you don't have to use these stickers for every video. Sometimes use your stickers, sometimes caption the video with the actual contents, of the video. So, don't use it every time, but I would use it a lot of the times. Make sure you're switching through, especially when you're first growing your account.

54
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:38.660
So now that you know how to edit your videos, you can actually start posting them. Caption the video something aesthetically pleasing, such as, at Hurdled is the best sports page on IG. Simple, but it gets the point across. You want to be posting at a minimum.

55
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:55.680
5 times per day, but you can post as many times as you'd like. And remember, you're not really editing anything in these videos. All you're doing is popping the sticker on it and reposting it. You're repurposing it, so it shouldn't be very hard to post 5, 10, 15 times a day. You're just searching for videos and reposting them, downloading them.

56
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.100
And putting them on your own page.

57
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.620
Now, as a general rule of thumb.

58
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.640
The more you post, the better.

59
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.920
My brother is actually gaining 30,000 followers a day in an incredibly profitable niche, and he posts 30-plus times per day.

60
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:18.090
There's pages out there that are posting 50 times a day that have millions of followers. Obviously, you don't have to do that, but…

61
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.030
The more you post, the more consistent you are with posting, The faster you'll see success.

62
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.810
And then make sure to wait at least 4 minutes between each post.

63
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.710
If you don't wait 4 minutes, you risk getting action blocked and suspended, potentially

64
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:40.550
Completely banned. So make sure you're waiting at least 4 minutes. 5 to 10 minutes is probably good, but make sure you're within that 4-minute window.

65
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.450
Now you're posting, you're wondering when you're gonna start gaining followers. I went over this in the client accounts, but it's the same exact thing.

66
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.780
Sometimes it can be your second video, sometimes it's your 500th video.

67
00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.280
As long as you're consistent, you will reach a point where you start to gain lots and lots of followers quickly.

68
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.890
So, just make sure you're staying consistent, post as many times as you want per day, the more the better.

69
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:17.860
Lastly, and I went over this with the client's accounts too, this is a game of consistency. If you are the person who can post 10 times per day, every single day, for 6 weeks, 6 months.

70
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:25.250
You will make this Mothership account, and you will grow it, and you'll have hundreds of thousands of followers, and then when you create more client accounts.

71
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.140
And you work for new clients, Those accounts will be…

72
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.440
Generating views way faster, they'll be gaining followers way faster.

73
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.720
And everything will be easier for you, and you'll make way more money.

74
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.220
So this is very important when it comes to the mothership accounts.

75
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.240
Okay, so that's everything for Mothership accounts.

76
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.150
client accounts, I think that's gonna be the… it's either the next video, or it was the video that you just watched.

77
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.760
But, they go hand in hand.

78
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.390
Some of them have the same principles.

79
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:17.650
Make sure you're working on both. Again, like I said, the mothership account is technically optional, you don't have to use it, but if you want to find a way to start growing your accounts faster, the Mothership account is something that you should definitely be prioritizing and using.

80
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.130
So, yeah.

81
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:32.350
Let me know if you guys have any questions. Again, drop those questions in the chat when you're watching these videos, if you have any questions at all, or you can shoot me a DM, but I prefer the chat so that everyone can see your questions, it's not…

82
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.240
Everyone's asking the same question in the DMs at the same time.

83
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:42.130
So again, Keep watching these videos, and I will see you on the live trainings.

84
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.480
See you guys later.
